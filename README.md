Blueprint
=========

Blueprint is a rapid prototyping framework based on [Apple Keynote](http://www.apple.com/uk/iwork/keynote/)

Using the pre-built icons, toolbars and widgets you can quickly and easily visualise ideas and export them to prototyping apps for testing, such as [Flinto](https://www.flinto.com).
