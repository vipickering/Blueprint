Blueprint
=========

Blueprint is a rapid prototyping framework based on [Apple Keynote](http://www.apple.com/uk/iwork/keynote/)

Using the pre-built icons, toolbars and widgets you can quickly and easily visualise ideas and export them to prototyping apps for testing, such as [Flinto](https://www.flinto.com).

Theme Setup
=========

Setup is easy and quick even if you aren't familiar with Keynote.

To install the themes, download them and double click on it. 

Keynote '09 should open.

Once it is open, go to File > Save Theme, you will be presented with the option to name the theme and store it in a folder here HD>Users>Home>Library>Application Support>iWork>Keynote>Themes.

Once you have saved it, quit Keynote. Open Keynote and go to the "New from theme choose". Your new "imported" theme will be at the bottom after all of the Apple standard themes.

Repeat for each theme you want to import.

Using The Tools
=========
Once you have the theme running, simple open the blueprint keynote file(s) you wish to use and drag the interface elements over to your file to custom create your app.
